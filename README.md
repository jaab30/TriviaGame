##Trivia Game

This is a Trivia Game based on the Seinfeld TV Series. Starts by clicking on the “Start” button. The game will go through a series of 10 questions. Each question has a time limit of 30 seconds. If the user Clicks on the correct answer, he/she will get a screen telling the user that it was correct, and it will display an image (gif) from the TV Series. If the user clicks on the wrong answer, he/she will get a screen telling the user that the answer was incorrect, and it will show the correct answer. If the time runs out, he/she will get a screen telling the user that the time ran out, and it will show the correct answer. All these messages in between each question are timed and they will only show for 5 seconds before they go to the next question. At the end, the user will see the results and have the chance to restart the game.
